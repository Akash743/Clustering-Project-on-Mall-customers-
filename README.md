# Clustering-Project-on-Mall-customers-
Explanatory clustering project on mall customers. 

Clustering in simple terms means grouping of similar point together into clusters

It is an unsupervised ML task.

**Applications of Clustering**

Segregating and targeting customers based on their Spending trends(which we will be doing in this exercise)
Identifying cancer cells by classifying them against healthy cells
Hashtags in Social media to classify hashtags under different heads
Image recognition techniques, etc.

In this project, we'll be using diffreent clustering algorithms to segregate the customers based on their spending scores.

Once clustered, each individual group can be targeted separately to further the business agenda.
